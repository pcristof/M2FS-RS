The M2FS data reduction package
Build on a the code of Matthew Walker.
Revamped by P. I. Cristofari in March/April 2023.

Overal structure:
- m2fs_process.py contains functions written by Matthew Walker
- function_dump.py contains additional functions or modified verisons of the m2fs_process.py functions
- class_dump.py contains a single class to wrap up the reduction with several methods greatly inspired from Matthew Walkers' initial reduction scripts.

A simple script can be edited to perform the full reduction using the object defined in class_dump.py. An example of such script is reduce.py.

NB: Some of the functions are interactive and will require user inputs. A program could be built upon this script, and a user config file could control the reduction options.

NB: Right now several quantities are initiliazed in the object. These should rather be placed in a configuration file. The config file file should then populate the object attributes.

Example, notebook, manual to come.


m2fs_zero_jan20.py
m2fs_dark.py
m2fs_reduce_jan20.py
m2fs_apertures_jan20.py

Run the above in that sequence.  All of them refer to m2fs_process.py
